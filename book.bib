 abstractNote={The use of biomarkers as early warning systems in the evaluation of disease risk has increased markedly in the last decade. Biomarkers are indicators of typical biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological reactions to therapy. The application and identification of biomarkers in the medical and clinical fields have an enormous impact on society. In this review, we discuss the history, various definitions, classifications, characteristics, and discovery of biomarkers. Furthermore, the potential application of biomarkers in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of various diseases over the last decade are reviewed. The present review aims to inspire readers to explore new avenues in biomarker research and development.},

  abstractNote={Embedded pragmatic clinical trials (ePCTs) are conducted during routine clinical care and have the potential to increase knowledge about the effectiveness of interventions under real world conditions. However, many pragmatic trials rely on data from the electronic health record (EHR) data, which are subject to bias from incomplete data, poor data quality, lack of representation from people who are medically underserved, and implicit bias in EHR design. This commentary examines how the use of EHR data might exacerbate bias and potentially increase health inequities. We offer recommendations for how to increase generalizability of ePCT results and begin to mitigate bias to promote health equity.},

  abstractNote={Embedded pragmatic clinical trials (ePCTs) play a vital role in addressing current population health problems, and their use of electronic health record (EHR) systems promises efficiencies that will increase the speed and volume of relevant and generalizable research. However, as the number of ePCTs using EHR-derived data grows, so does the risk that research will become more vulnerable to biases due to differences in data capture and access to care for different subsets of the population, thereby propagating inequities in health and the healthcare system. We identify 3 challenges—incomplete and variable capture of data on social determinants of health, lack of representation of vulnerable populations that do not access or receive treatment, and data loss due to variable use of technology—that exacerbate bias when working with EHR data and offer recommendations and examples of ways to actively mitigate bias.},

  DOI={10.1093/jamia/ocac028},
  abstractNote={Population health management (PHM) is an important approach to promote wellness and deliver health care to targeted individuals who meet criteria for preventive measures or treatment. A critical component for any PHM program is a data analytics platform that can target those eligible individuals. Objective: The aim of this study was to design and implement a scalable standards-based clinical decision support (CDS) approach to identify patient cohorts for PHM and maximize opportunities for multi-site dissemination. Materials and Methods: An architecture was established to support bidirectional data exchanges between heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) data sources, PHM systems, and CDS components. HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources and CDS Hooks were used to facilitate interoperability and dissemination. The approach was validated by deploying the platform at multiple sites to identify patients who meet the criteria for genetic evaluation of familial cancer. Results: The Genetic Cancer Risk Detector (GARDE) platform was created and is comprised of four components: (1) an open-source CDS Hooks server for computing patient eligibility for PHM cohorts, (2) an open-source Population Coordinator that processes GARDE requests and communicates results to a PHM system, (3) an EHR Patient Data Repository, and (4) EHR PHM Tools to manage patients and perform outreach functions. Site-specific deployments were performed on onsite virtual machines and cloud-based Amazon Web Services. Discussion: GARDE’s component architecture establishes generalizable standards-based methods for computing PHM cohorts. Replicating deployments using one of the established deployment methods requires minimal local customization. Most of the deployment effort was related to obtaining site-specific information technology governance approvals.}, number={5}, journal={Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA},

  abstractNote={Uptake of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening remains suboptimal. Mailed fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) offers promise for increasing screening rates, but optimal strategies for implementation have not been well synthesized. In June 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a meeting of subject matter experts and stakeholders to answer key questions regarding mailed FIT implementation in the US. Points of agreement included: 1) Primers such as texts, phone calls, and printed mailings prior to mailed FIT appear to contribute to effectiveness; 2) Invitation letters should be brief, easy to read, and signatory should be tailored based on setting; 3) Instructions for FIT completion should be simple and address challenges that may lead to failed lab processing, such as notation of collection date; 4) Reminders delivered to initial non-completers should be utilized to increase FIT return; 5) Data infrastructure should identify eligible patients and track each step in the outreach process, from primer delivery through abnormal FIT follow up; 6) Protocols and procedures such as navigation should be in place to promote colonoscopy after abnormal FIT; 7) A high-quality, 1 sample FIT should be used; 8) Sustainability requires a program champion and organizational support for the work, including sufficient funding, and external policies (such as quality reporting requirements) to drive commitment to program investment; and 9) Cost effectiveness of mailed FIT has been established. Participants concluded that Mailed FIT is an effective and efficient strategy with great potential for increasing CRC screening in diverse healthcare settings if more widely implemented.},

  abstractNote={Increasing numbers of unaffected individuals could benefit from genetic evaluation for inherited cancer susceptibility. Automated conversational agents (ie, chatbots) are being developed for cancer genetics contexts; however, randomized comparisons with standard of care (SOC) are needed.To examine whether chatbot and SOC approaches are equivalent in completion of pretest cancer genetic services and genetic testing.This equivalence trial (Broadening the Reach, Impact, and Delivery of Genetic Services [BRIDGE] randomized clinical trial) was conducted between August 15, 2020, and August 31, 2023, at 2 US health care systems (University of Utah Health and NYU Langone Health). Participants were aged 25 to 60 years, had had a primary care visit in the previous 3 years, were eligible for cancer genetic evaluation, were English or Spanish speaking, had no prior cancer diagnosis other than nonmelanoma skin cancer, had no prior cancer genetic counseling or testing, and had an electronic patient portal account.Participants were randomized 1:1 at the patient level to the study groups at each site. In the chatbot intervention group, patients were invited in a patient portal outreach message to complete a pretest genetics education chat. In the enhanced SOC control group, patients were invited to complete an SOC pretest appointment with a certified genetic counselor.Primary outcomes were completion of pretest cancer genetic services (ie, pretest genetics education chat or pretest genetic counseling appointment) and completion of genetic testing. Equivalence hypothesis testing was used to compare the study groups.This study included 3073 patients (1554 in the chatbot group and 1519 in the enhanced SOC control group). Their mean (SD) age at outreach was 43.8 (9.9) years, and most (2233 of 3063 [72.9%]) were women. A total of 204 patients (7.3%) were Black, 317 (11.4%) were Latinx, and 2094 (75.0%) were White. The estimated percentage point difference for completion of pretest cancer genetic services between groups was 2.0 (95% CI, −1.1 to 5.0). The estimated percentage point difference for completion of genetic testing was −1.3 (95% CI, −3.7 to 1.1). Analyses suggested equivalence in the primary outcomes.The findings of the BRIDGE equivalence trial support the use of chatbot approaches to offer cancer genetic services. Chatbot tools can be a key component of sustainable and scalable population health management strategies to enhance access to cancer genetic services.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03985852},

The Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s (IHI’s) Triple Aim Initiative uses the term population health management to describe the work by healthcare organizations to improve outcomes for individual patients to maximize population health. The National Academy of Medicine favors the term population health improvement and uses this term to describe work to identify and improve aspects of or contributors to population health, expanding the focus beyond traditional healthcare delivery systems. As organizations like IHI and the National Academy of Medicine continue to focus on population health, the terms and definitions used to describe these activities will continue to evolve.The use of consistent, clear definitions for population health activities is critical to the practice of pharmacy and healthcare delivery.},
