Electronic monitoring devices are digital tools that can be used to track health behaviors such as:

* Sleep
* Physical activity
* Medication-taking

Electronic monitoring devices enable researchers to track day-to-day health behaviors in the patient’s **"real-world" setting**. This allows researchers to explore patterns or changes in a patient’s health behavior and provides a richer understanding of **daily behavior over time**. 


### Benefits of Monitoring Data

1) Electronic monitoring devices often include data transmission abilities that enable healthcare providers or researchers to access these data in near **real-time** potentially informing intervention and/or medical decision-making.

1) Electronic monitoring devices also have the potential to produce **more accurate** estimates of health behaviors than alternative strategies (e.g., self-report) as they are not subject to recall bias and can detect efforts to inflate adherence due to social desirability.
