# Clinical Data Uses

## Learning Objectives

## General uses of clinical data

### Cancer Prevention and Care

The near universal adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the US has created unprecedented opportunities to improve cancer prevention and care. As described in previous chapters, EHR systems store comprehensive longitudinal records of a patient's interactions with a healthcare system, including data about demographics, conditions, family history, clinical notes, laboratory test results, medications, procedures, imaging, and genetic test reports. These data can be accessed not only by health professionals, but also by patients through patient portals. EHR data can also be used to enable data-driven interventions such as provider- and patient-facing clinical decision support (CDS) and population health management (PHM).

CDS has been defined as tools that "provide clinicians, staff, patients, or other individuals with knowledge and person-specific information, intelligently filtered or presented at appropriate times, to enhance health and health care" [@Osheroff_2007]. Examples of widely adopted CDS tools with demonstrated effectiveness for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and care include

  * provider and patient reminders for cancer screening
  * decision aids and shared decision-making tools (e.g., for prostate cancer treatment, lung cancer screening)
  * AI-supported diagnostic imaging
  * chemotherapy decision support
  * at-home symptom care

While CDS tools generally provide decision support focused on a specific patient at a time, PHM are strategies that target specific patient populations [@Swarthout_Bishop_2017]. PHM efforts generally consist of

  * population algorithms that are applied over EHR and other data sources to identify individuals who are eligible for a specific healthcare intervention (e.g., colorectal cancer screening, tobacco cessation, HPV vaccination)
  * patient engagement strategies (e.g., patient portals, text messaging, chatbots, patient navigators) that provide education and access to those interventions
  * analytic tools that assess the effectiveness of the PHM program.

Several PHM programs have demonstrated to be effective in increasing the uptake of cancer prevention. For example, the colorectal cancer screening program at Kaiser Permanente uses digital (i.e., text messaging, patient portal), mailed, and patient navigation approaches to increase colorectal cancer screening by mailing Fecal Immunohistochemical Test (FIT) kits to patients' homes [@Gupta2020]. Also the Cancer Moonshot BRIDGE trial used the GARDE platform [@Bradshaw2022] (ITCR-funded) to identify candidates for genetic testing of hereditary cancer syndromes based on EHR data; and for patient outreach, pre- and post-test education via automated chatbots [@Kaphingst2024].

While some CDS and PHM approaches have been successfully adopted widely, emerging technologies such as the use of generative AI approaches to analyze diagnostic imaging, large language models (LLMs) to extract information from narrative texts (e.g., clinical notes), LLM-based chatbots to communicate with patients, and digital health tools such as home-based sensors are creating unprecedented opportunities for next generation CDS and PHM. These approaches have the potential to enable significant breakthroughs through the implementation of patient-tailored cancer prevention and care at a population scale. Nevertheless, substantial research is needed to ensure effective, fair, and equitable implementation of these CDS and PHM interventions.

## Types of questions that can be asked with clinical data

### Risk Prediction

Risk prediction in clinical research involves using data to assess the likelihood of certain outcomes or events occurring in patients. This could include predicting the risk of developing a particular disease, experiencing a specific complication, or responding to a treatment.

Data used for risk prediction can come from various sources, including:

  * Clinical Data: This includes patient demographics, medical history, laboratory results, and imaging studies.
  * Genetic Data: Genetic information, such as DNA sequencing results, can provide valuable insights into an individual's susceptibility to certain diseases.
  * Environmental and Lifestyle Data: Factors such as diet, exercise habits, smoking status, and environmental exposures can influence disease risk and may be included in risk prediction models.
  * Biomarkers: Biological markers indicative of disease or physiological processes can be used as predictors in risk models [@Bodaghi_Fattahi_Ramazani_2023].

Once relevant data is collected, statistical and machine learning techniques can be applied to develop predictive models. These models aim to identify patterns and relationships within the data that are associated with the outcome of interest. Common techniques include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.

After the model is trained on a dataset, it can be validated using independent datasets to assess its performance and generalizability. Once validated, the model can be used to predict risk in new patients based on their individual characteristics and data.

Clinical prediction rules are a subset of risk prediction models, specific to clinical research.

Overall, risk prediction in clinical research allows healthcare professionals to identify individuals at higher risk of certain outcomes, enabling targeted interventions, personalized treatments, and more efficient resource allocation.

### Cohort identification for research

Clinical data plays a crucial role in cohort identification for research purposes. Researchers typically use electronic health records (EHRs), medical databases, or registries to identify cohorts based on specific criteria such as age, gender, medical conditions, treatments, medications, and outcomes. Advanced data mining and natural language processing techniques can also be employed to extract relevant information from unstructured data sources like clinical notes. Once cohorts are identified, researchers can analyze the data to study disease progression, treatment effectiveness, and outcomes.

Cohort identification is important regardless of research study type, but to provide specific examples:

* Research Design: Identifying cohorts allows researchers to design studies with appropriate inclusion or exclusion criteria. By selecting specific groups of individuals with similar characteristics or exposures, researchers can investigate hypotheses effectively.
* Clinical Insights: Cohort studies enable researchers to observe the natural history of diseases, track outcomes over time, and assess the effectiveness of interventions or treatments. Understanding how different factors influence disease progression or treatment response can inform clinical decision-making and improve patient care.
* Epidemiological Studies: Cohort identification is crucial for epidemiological research to understand the incidence, prevalence, and risk factors associated with diseases. By following cohorts over time, researchers can identify trends, patterns, and associations that contribute to our understanding of disease causation and prevention.
* Precision Medicine: Identifying cohorts based on genetic profiles, biomarkers, or other specific characteristics allows researchers to tailor treatments and interventions to individual patients. This approach, known as precision medicine, aims to optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing adverse effects.
* Healthcare Policy and Planning: Cohort studies provide valuable data for informing healthcare policies, resource allocation, and public health strategies. By identifying high-risk populations or groups with specific healthcare needs, policymakers can develop targeted interventions to improve health outcomes and reduce disparities.

### Case report forms

In clinical research, case report forms (CRFs) are essential tools for collecting standardized data from study participants. Note that case report forms are any paper or form that will be filled in at the case or participant level. By that definition, even a consent form is a case report form! And each clinical study may utilize multiple CRFs (e.g., one for consent, another for medical history, another for reporting any adverse effects). CRFs are useful for several tasks already discussed within this chapter -- specifically, tracking adverse events or outcomes (like those discussed in the Risk Prediction section) or tracking demographics and medical history for identifying cohorts (as discussed in the Cohort Identification section). CRFs are also useful for topics this chapter will discuss in later sections (e.g., Retrospective analyses).

Designing CRFs that are inclusive, accessible, and sensitive to the diverse needs of participants, particularly marginalized groups, requires careful consideration. Questions within CRFs should be formulated to gather comprehensive and accurate clinical data while ensuring participants feel safe, respected, and comfortable. This section explores the types of questions that can be asked using CRFs with a focus on **accessibility, sensitivity, inclusivity, and comfort for marginalized people**

::: {.notice}

While within a study, CRFs help to ensure standardization in data collection, there may be a lack of standardization when comparing data between studies if each study did not use the same CRFs or comparable/subsets of questions within forms. This section will provide guidelines for types of questions that may be found within CRFs and writing these questions; however, there aren't necessarily templates that have been used widely within the field. Further, your specific study needs may also require different or additional types of questions -- the guidelines within this section are not exhaustive/all-encompassing of what may be encountered within the field.

:::

Here, we explore the different categories of questions that may be included within case report forms:

1. **Demographic and Socioeconomic Questions**

Capturing demographic and socioeconomic data is fundamental in clinical research to understand the background of study participants. However, these questions must be asked in a manner that respects privacy, avoids assumptions, and helps identify people with different life experiences. It’s also good practice in order to respect privacy to include an option allowing the participants to leave the question unanswered or respond with “prefer not to answer”.

- **Sex and Gender**: When asking about gender and sex include an option of “prefer to self-describe” to capture more information.
- **Ethnicity and Race**: Ethnicity and race questions should be specific and use respectful language, allowing participants to self-identify rather than selecting from a predefined list.
- **Socioeconomic Status**: Questions about employment, income, or education should be framed to capture social determinants of health without making participants feel judged. For example, asking, "What is your current employment status?" with choices that include full-time, part-time, unemployed, student, and unable to work can help gather relevant data without stigma.

It is essential to use neutral, non-judgmental language and to explain why these questions are being asked, ensuring participants understand the relevance of their responses.

2. **Health and Medial History Questions**

Health and medical history questions provide critical information about participants' baseline conditions and potential risk factors. These questions should be framed clearly and respectfully to avoid any discomfort.

- **Medical Conditions and History**: Questions about past and present health conditions should use clear, accessible language. For example, "Have you ever been diagnosed with any of the following conditions? (Please check all that apply)" followed by a comprehensive and inclusive list.
- **Medication Use**: Questions about current and past medications should include over-the-counter and alternative therapies, and space should be provided for free-text responses to capture additional details.
- **Disability and Functional Status**: For many populations, it is important to use person-first language, such as "Do you have any physical, sensory, or cognitive impairments that you would like us to be aware of?" and provide space for participants to describe their specific needs. However, different populations have different preferences. The "Disability Language Style Guide" from the National Center on Disability and Journalism provides some basic guidelines, thorough discussion, and community specific advice on this topic [@ncdj_style_guide].

Avoiding medical jargon and providing definitions or examples can help ensure that participants understand the questions, and confidentiality should be emphasized to encourage honest responses.

3. **Experience and Quality of Life Questions**

Understanding how health conditions and treatments affect participants' daily lives and well-being is essential, particularly for those from marginalized communities who may experience unique challenges.

- **Daily Living and Social Functioning**: Questions like "How often do your health conditions affect your ability to perform daily tasks (e.g., cooking, cleaning, working)?" can help assess the impact on daily life, with options ranging from "never" to "always."
- **Emotional and Psychological Well-Being**: Including questions such as "In the past week, how often have you felt anxious or depressed?" using a scale from "not at all" to "very often" can provide insights into mental health needs.
- **Support Systems and Social Networks**: Asking about social support (e.g., "Do you have someone you can rely on for emotional support?") can help identify participants' needs for social and emotional resources.

Using sensitive language and providing mental health support resources where needed is crucial when discussing emotional well-being to avoid triggering emotional distress.

4. **Sexual and Reproductive Health Questions**

Questions about sexual and reproductive health must be asked with sensitivity, as they can be deeply personal, particularly for marginalized groups who may face stigma.

- **Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI)**: Instead of just predefined categories, open-ended questions like "How would you describe your sexual orientation?" and "What is your gender identity?" allow participants to self-identify. Offering the option to skip these questions respects participants' privacy.  Options can be provided with a space or text box for the person to fill in their own descriptor, but having the categorical data will allow for easier analysis for those that select one rather than every response being from variable open text responses.
- **Reproductive Health**: Questions about menstrual health, contraception, or pregnancy should be framed neutrally. For example, "Are you currently using any form of contraception? If yes, please specify."
- **Sexual Activity and History**: Questions should be direct but framed sensitively, such as "Are there any sexual health concerns you would like to discuss? Your answers will help us understand how to better support your care needs."

These questions should always be optional, with confidentiality emphasized to encourage honest, comfortable participation.

5. **Treatment Preferences and Decision-Making Questions**

Understanding participants’ preferences for treatment and decision-making is vital for providing patient-centered care, especially for those from historically underserved groups.

- **Decision-Making Preferences**: Questions like "How involved would you like to be in decisions about your healthcare?" offer a range of choices from “I prefer to make decisions myself” to “I prefer my healthcare provider to make decisions,” allowing participants to express their autonomy.
- **Cultural and Religious Considerations**: Asking, "Are there any cultural, religious, or personal beliefs that we should consider when discussing treatment options with you?" ensures that care is respectful and culturally appropriate.
- **Treatment Burden**: Questions such as "What level of inconvenience or side effects would be acceptable to you when considering a treatment?" help to gauge participants' preferences and comfort levels.

These questions should be framed to respect participants’ autonomy and encourage honest responses without fear of judgment.

6. **Accessibility and Accommodation Needs Questions**

To ensure that all participants can fully engage with the study, it is essential to ask about accessibility and accommodation needs.

- **Language and Communication Needs**: "What is your preferred language for communication? Do you need an interpreter or translated materials?" These questions help ensure language inclusivity.
- **Physical Accessibility**: Asking, "Do you require any specific accommodations to participate in this study (e.g., wheelchair access, hearing aids, visual aids)?" ensures physical accessibility.
- **Format Preferences**: "Would you prefer to complete this form online, on paper, or verbally with assistance?" helps accommodate different needs and preferences.
Providing multiple options and allowing participants to request changes at any time is crucial to accommodate evolving needs.

Providing multiple options and allowing participants to request changes at any time is crucial to accommodate evolving needs.

7. **Cultural Sensitivity and Identity Questions**

CRFs should respect diverse cultural backgrounds, values, and identities without perpetuating biases or assumptions.

- **Cultural Identity and Practices**: An open-ended question such as "Are there any cultural practices or beliefs that are important for us to be aware of in your care?" allows participants to share relevant information.
- **Dietary Restrictions and Preferences**: Asking, "Do you have any dietary restrictions or preferences that are culturally or religiously motivated?" ensures that these are respected.
- **Community and Belonging**: "Is there anything about your community or background that you would like us to know to provide better care?" encourages participants to share relevant aspects of their identity.

These questions should be open-ended, allowing participants to skip questions they find irrelevant or uncomfortable.

8. **Ensuring Comfort, Trust, and Privacy Questions**

Fostering a sense of safety and trust is especially important for marginalized individuals who may have experienced discrimination in healthcare settings.

- **Comfort and Confidentiality**: Asking, "Do you feel comfortable with the way your information is being collected and stored? Are there any specific concerns you would like to address?" helps build trust.
- **Feedback and Preferences**: "Is there anything about this form or the study process that you find confusing, uncomfortable, or concerning?" invites participants to share their feedback.
- **Consent and Voluntary Participation**: Questions like, "Would you like to be contacted about the results of this study or for future research opportunities? Participation is entirely voluntary." reinforce autonomy and respect.

Reminding participants of the confidentiality and voluntary nature of their involvement can help foster a trusting environment.

::: {.warning}

The guidelines above sometimes suggest use of open-ended questions where participants would provide free-text responses rather than selecting pre-defined categories. This will require researchers to process those free-text responses and may decrease the overall standardization.

:::

Designing specific and sensitive CRFs for clinical studies requires a thoughtful approach that respects the different backgrounds, privacy, and comfort of all participants, especially those from marginalized communities. By using accessible language, offering multiple options, respecting autonomy, and providing a safe space for participants to express themselves, researchers can gather meaningful and accurate data while ensuring participants feel valued and respected. These considerations are vital to fostering clinical research that captures enough information about a wide variety of individuals. Case report forms (CRFs) are often tailored to specific studies and may vary widely in structure and content, lacking standardization across different projects. Despite this, certain themes are commonly expected in CRFs, including sections on participant demographics, medical history, treatment outcomes, and adverse events, ensuring essential data collection across a variety of study designs. By thoughtfully addressing both unique study requirements and universally relevant data points, researchers can optimize CRFs for consistency across clinical studies.

## Research Design Considerations

Researchers need to intentionally use methods earlier in the research process than data analysis to manage data biases associated with clinical data, especially EHR.

One of the most important challenges in using EHR data in cancer research is that, as in many other fields, healthcare data are plagued with several types of biases that result from disparities in the delivery of healthcare. Overall, cancer research has historically relied on data from high resource academic medical centers, which disproportionately provide care to patients who are White, have high socioeconomic status, and live in urban areas. As a result, medical knowledge produced from these data have disproportionately benefited those patients. Different sources of bias are prevalent in EHR data. For example,

* *Information representativeness bias* occurs when certain groups are disproportionately less present in the EHR because they have no contact with the healthcare system.
* *Information presence bias*, on the other hand, occurs when certain groups may be represented in the EHR, but have disproportionately less comprehensive healthcare data due to issues such as overall lower access to and use of healthcare service, lack of a primary care provider, lack of access to specialty care, and lack of access to digital resources (e.g., patient portals, home sensors, telehealth) that can be used to provide healthcare data.
* *Treatment biases* happen when certain groups receive disproportionate access to more advanced treatments, which is often determined by social drivers such as insurance, distance, health literacy, and socioeconomic status.
* *Algorithm bias* further amplifies these previous sources of bias by leveraging biased EHR data to make predictions about diagnosis, treatment and prognosis that are used by clinicians to make potentially biased healthcare decisions, which are then documented in the EHR.

Recent advances in sophisticated and costly technology such as genetic testing, artificial intelligence, and digital health, which are disproportionately available in high resource healthcare systems further compound the problem. Therefore, cancer researchers increasingly need to use intentional methods to prevent, identify, and correct for biases in EHR data. For example, the National Institutes of Health Pragmatic Trials Collaboratory has made several recommendations to address EHR data biases in research [@BoydCCT2023; @BoydJAMIA2023]:

* Include data from low resource healthcare settings such as community health centers that provide care for patients who are racially diverse, have low socioeconomic status and live in rural areas.
* Engage with diverse communities in study design and conduct to ensure proper representation, data collection, analysis, and representation.
* Use data collection methods for self-reported data that rely on more accessible technology such as text messaging, using accessible and culturally adapted communication.
* Include subgroup analysis by different demographic groups according to variables such as socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, sex, geographical location, and social determinants of health.

With such approaches, cancer researchers while aiming to avoid exacerbating health disparities, in addition help to reduce disparities.
